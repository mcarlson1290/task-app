# Replit Instructions: Fix "Only My Tasks" to Stack with Other Filters

## Current Problem
The "Only My Tasks" checkbox resets all other filters instead of working together with them. This means users can't see "just my tasks for today" - they see all their tasks across all dates.

## Desired Behavior
"Only My Tasks" should ADD to existing filters, not replace them:
- Date filter: Today → Shows all tasks for today
- Date filter: Today + Only My Tasks → Shows only YOUR tasks for today
- Category filter: Cleaning + Only My Tasks → Shows only YOUR cleaning tasks

## Implementation Logic

### Current (Wrong) Behavior
When "Only My Tasks" is clicked:
1. Clears all other filters
2. Shows all tasks assigned to current user
3. Ignores date, category, status filters

### Correct Behavior
When "Only My Tasks" is clicked:
1. Keep all existing filters active
2. ADD assignment filtering on top
3. Show tasks that match ALL active filters

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Login
1. User opens app (default shows today's tasks)
2. Sees 20 tasks for today (all users)
3. Clicks "Only My Tasks"
4. Now sees 5 tasks (just their tasks for today)

### Scenario 2: Specific Category
1. User selects "Seeding" category
2. Sees 8 seeding tasks across all dates
3. Clicks "Only My Tasks"
4. Now sees 3 seeding tasks assigned to them

### Scenario 3: Future Planning
1. User selects next Monday's date
2. Sees 15 tasks scheduled for Monday
3. Clicks "Only My Tasks"
4. Now sees 4 tasks they need to do on Monday

## Filter Stacking Logic

All active filters should work together using AND logic:
```
Show tasks where:
  - Date matches selected date (if date filter active)
  - AND category matches selected category (if category filter active)
  - AND status matches selected status (if status filter active)
  - AND assigned to current user (if "Only My Tasks" checked)
  - AND priority matches selected priority (if priority filter active)
```

## Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't clear other filters** when "Only My Tasks" is toggled
2. **Don't reset the date** to "all dates" 
3. **Don't change filter mode** from AND to OR
4. **Preserve all filter states** in the URL/state

## User Experience Benefits

This change allows workers to:
- Quickly see what they personally need to do today
- Plan ahead by checking their tasks for tomorrow
- Focus on their specific responsibilities
- Still see team tasks by unchecking the filter

## Testing the Fix

1. Set date filter to today
2. Check "Only My Tasks" 
3. Verify you see only your tasks for today (not all your tasks ever)
4. Add category filter
5. Verify you see only your tasks in that category for today
6. Uncheck "Only My Tasks"
7. Verify you see all tasks in that category for today (team-wide)
