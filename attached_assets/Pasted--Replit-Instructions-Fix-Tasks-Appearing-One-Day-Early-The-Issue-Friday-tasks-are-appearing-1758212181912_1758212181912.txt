# Replit Instructions: Fix Tasks Appearing One Day Early

## The Issue
Friday tasks are appearing on Thursday. Tasks seem to be visible one day before they should be. This is a critical issue for farm operations where timing is precise.

## Root Cause
The visibility logic is likely showing tasks when current date >= (visibleFromDate - 1 day) instead of exactly on the visibleFromDate.

## For Weekly Tasks
**Current behavior**: Friday task appears on Thursday
**Correct behavior**: Friday task appears ONLY on Friday

### The Fix
Weekly tasks should be visible ONLY on their exact due date, not the day before.

For weekly tasks:
- visibleFromDate and dueDate should be the SAME date
- Task should only be visible when TODAY equals that date
- No early visibility

## For Monthly/Bi-Weekly/Quarterly Tasks
These tasks have visibility windows and should appear throughout their period:
- Monthly: Visible from 1st through last day
- Bi-weekly: Visible throughout their respective periods
- Quarterly: Visible throughout the quarter

These are working correctly and should not change.

## Critical Business Rule
**Farm operations require precise timing**. Tasks must NOT appear early because:
- Plant growth cycles are precisely timed
- Doing tasks early disrupts the growing process
- Each task is scheduled for optimal plant development

## Verification Test
1. Create a weekly task for Friday only
2. Check on Thursday - should NOT see the Friday task
3. Check on Friday - should see the Friday task
4. Check on Saturday - should NOT see the Friday task

## Common Causes of Day-Offset Issues

1. **Timezone conversions** shifting dates by a day
2. **Greater-than-or-equal** comparisons that should be **equal-only** for weekly tasks
3. **Date parsing** that interprets dates as previous day

## Expected Behavior Summary

**Weekly tasks**: Visible ONLY on their assigned day
- Wednesday task → Visible only on Wednesday
- Friday task → Visible only on Friday
- NOT visible the day before

**All other frequencies**: Continue working as they are (with visibility windows)
