# Replit Instructions: USE EXISTING DATA - STOP CREATING NEW TABLES

**CRITICAL: STOP CREATING NEW DATA DISPLAYS. The data already exists in the Production Data page!**

## The Problem
The agent:
1. Created a NEW table showing "Recent Production Trays"
2. Created NEW fake data (K072924-ROM-A1, etc.)
3. Added this to Production Data page where data ALREADY EXISTS

## What Actually Needs to Happen

### 1. FIND the Existing Data
The Production Data page ALREADY HAS tray data. Look for:
- The existing Tray Tracking tab/section
- Cards or displays showing trays like "K071725-MG-BROC-01A"
- The data structure that's ALREADY THERE

```javascript
// DO NOT CREATE NEW DATA
// DO NOT CREATE NEW TABLES
// FIND AND USE WHAT EXISTS
```

### 2. DELETE the New Table
Remove the "Recent Production Trays" table that was just added:

```javascript
// DELETE THIS:
<div className="recent-production-trays">
  <h2>Recent Production Trays</h2>
  <table>...</table>
</div>

// This table should NOT exist - remove it!
```

### 3. Find Where Tray Data is Actually Stored
Look in the existing code for:
- How the Tray Tracking tab displays its data
- Where that data comes from
- The actual storage key/location

```javascript
// Look for existing code like:
// - How does Tray Tracking tab get its data?
// - What component renders the tray cards?
// - Where is the data source?

// DO NOT assume localStorage keys
// DO NOT create new storage
// FIND what's already there
```

### 4. Connect Tray Split to THAT Data

Once you find where the existing tray data comes from, connect to it:

```javascript
// In TraySplitStep
useEffect(() => {
  // Use the SAME data source as the Tray Tracking tab
  // Don't create new data
  // Don't assume storage locations
  // LOOK at how Tray Tracking gets its data and do the same
}, []);
```

### 5. What to Look For

The existing Tray Tracking probably shows:
- Tray cards with IDs like "K071725-MG-BROC-01A"
- Status indicators (growing, germinating, etc.)
- Location information
- Created by information

Find THAT code and use THAT data source.

## Instructions for the Agent:

1. **STOP creating new UI elements** - No new tables, no new displays
2. **FIND the existing Tray Tracking code** - It's already there
3. **TRACE how it gets data** - Follow the code to find the source
4. **USE that same source** - Don't create new data
5. **DELETE any new tables/data** you just added

## The Goal:
- Tray Split dropdown shows the SAME trays that appear in Tray Tracking
- No new data
- No new tables
- Use what exists

**DO NOT:**
- Create new localStorage keys
- Add new tables to Production Data
- Generate fake test data
- Assume data structure

**DO:**
- Find existing Tray Tracking implementation
- Use its data source
- Show the same trays in Tray Split
- Keep everything connected
