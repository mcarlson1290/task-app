IMPORTANT: Make ONLY this exact change. Do not modify any other code.
Problem: Weekly recurring tasks are not showing when the "Weekly" frequency filter is selected. The current filter logic checks if the frequency string contains day names (like "monday"), but weekly tasks have frequency: "weekly" with days stored in a separate daysOfWeek array.
File: client/src/pages/RecurringTasks.tsx
Find this code (around lines 85-109):
tsx    // Frequency filter
    if (frequencyFilter !== 'all') {
      filtered = filtered.filter(task => {
        const taskFreq = task.frequency.toLowerCase();
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'weekly') {
          // Weekly means it happens on specific days of the week
          return taskFreq.includes('monday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('tuesday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('wednesday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('thursday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('friday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('saturday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('sunday');
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'bi-weekly') {
          return taskFreq.includes('bi-weekly') || taskFreq.includes('biweekly');
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'monthly') {
          return taskFreq.includes('monthly');
        }
        
        return false;
      });
    }
Replace with:
tsx    // Frequency filter
    if (frequencyFilter !== 'all') {
      filtered = filtered.filter(task => {
        const taskFreq = task.frequency.toLowerCase();
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'weekly') {
          // Weekly tasks have frequency="weekly" and days in daysOfWeek array
          return taskFreq === 'weekly' || 
                 taskFreq.includes('monday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('tuesday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('wednesday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('thursday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('friday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('saturday') || 
                 taskFreq.includes('sunday');
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'bi-weekly') {
          return taskFreq === 'bi-weekly' || taskFreq === 'biweekly';
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'monthly') {
          return taskFreq === 'monthly';
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'quarterly') {
          return taskFreq === 'quarterly';
        }
        
        if (frequencyFilter === 'daily') {
          return taskFreq === 'daily';
        }
        
        return false;
      });
    }
The key change: Added taskFreq === 'weekly' as the primary check for weekly tasks. Also changed other filters from .includes() to exact === matches and added quarterly/daily support.
DO NOT make any other changes. Confirm when complete.
