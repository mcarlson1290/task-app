IMPORTANT: Do not delete any existing tasks, recurring tasks, or user data.
Problem: Bi-weekly recurring tasks are not working correctly. They show up every day instead of every 2 weeks. We need true bi-weekly (every 14 days from a start date).
This requires a multi-part fix:

PART 1: Add startDate field to recurring_tasks schema
In shared/schema.ts (or wherever the recurring_tasks table is defined), add a startDate field:
typescriptstartDate: timestamp("start_date"), // Anchor date for bi-weekly calculations
Then run any necessary database migration to add this column.

PART 2: Update RecurringTaskModal.tsx to capture startDate for bi-weekly tasks
In client/src/components/RecurringTaskModal.tsx:

Change the frequency label from 'Bi-Weekly (1st & 15th)' to 'Bi-Weekly (Every 2 Weeks)'
When frequency is 'bi-weekly', show a date picker for "Start Date" that lets the user choose when the 2-week cycle begins
Save this startDate to the recurring task record


PART 3: Fix the server-side generation logic in storage.ts
Standardize on 'bi-weekly' spelling (with hyphen).
Replace BOTH bi-weekly/biweekly case blocks with this logic:
typescriptcase 'bi-weekly':
case 'biweekly': {
  // True bi-weekly: every 14 days from the task's startDate
  const startDate = template.startDate ? new Date(template.startDate) : new Date(template.createdAt);
  
  // Calculate days since start date
  const currentDate = new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, dayOfMonth));
  const startDateUTC = new Date(Date.UTC(
    startDate.getUTCFullYear(),
    startDate.getUTCMonth(),
    startDate.getUTCDate()
  ));
  
  const daysDifference = Math.floor(
    (currentDate.getTime() - startDateUTC.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
  );
  
  // Only generate if today is exactly on a 14-day interval from start
  if (daysDifference >= 0 && daysDifference % 14 === 0) {
    const dueDate = new Date(Date.UTC(year, month, dayOfMonth));
    return this.buildTaskFromTemplate(template, {
      dueDate: dueDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
      visibleFromDate: dueDate.toISOString().split('T')[0],
    });
  }
  break;
}

PART 4: For existing bi-weekly recurring tasks without a startDate
After the schema change, existing bi-weekly tasks will have startDate = null. The code above falls back to createdAt in that case, which should work reasonably.
Optionally, you can update existing bi-weekly tasks to set their startDate to their createdAt value.

Summary of changes:

Schema: Add startDate column to recurring_tasks
UI: Add date picker for bi-weekly start date, fix label
Server: Fix generation logic to use true 14-day intervals
Normalize spelling to 'bi-weekly' throughout
