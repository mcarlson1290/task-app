Update the task categories throughout the app to be more specific for farm operations:

1. UPDATE TASK TYPE OPTIONS:
   Replace the current task types with these new categories:
   - "Seeding - Microgreens" 🌱
   - "Seeding - Leafy Greens" 🌿
   - "Harvest - Microgreens" 🌾
   - "Harvest - Leafy Greens" 🥬
   - "Blackout Tasks" 🌑 (for removing covers from seedlings)
   - "Moving" 📦 (relocating plants between systems)
   - "Packing" 📦
   - "Cleaning" 🧹
   - "Inventory" 📊
   - "Equipment Maintenance" 🔧
   - "Other" 📝

2. UPDATE FILTER BADGES:
   In the task filter section, update to show these new categories:
   - Keep "All Tasks" as the first option
   - Add all the new categories listed above
   - Adjust the filter badges to handle longer text (might need to wrap or use abbreviated versions on mobile)

3. UPDATE MOCK TASK DATA:
   Change the existing mock tasks to use the new categories:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 1,
     title: "Seed Arugula Trays",
     type: "Seeding - Microgreens",
     priority: "High",
     // ... rest of task
   },
   {
     id: 2,
     title: "Remove Covers - Tower 3",
     type: "Blackout Tasks",
     priority: "High",
     assignedTo: "Section A",
     status: "pending",
     estimatedTime: "45m",
     dueTime: "8:00 AM",
     quickInfo: "Day 2 blackout removal for proper stem height"
   }

COLOR CODING (optional but helpful):
Consider using different shades or icons for the category badges:

Seeding tasks: Green tones 🌱
Harvest tasks: Golden/orange tones 🌾
Blackout tasks: Dark purple/black ⚫
Maintenance tasks: Blue tones 🔧


UPDATE THE ADD TASK MODAL:
The Task Type dropdown should now show all these new options

This gives farm staff precise categorization for their daily operations and helps track specific workflows for microgreens vs leafy greens production!

This update makes the task categories much more specific to actual farm operations, which will help with:
- Better task filtering
- More accurate time estimates per task type
- Clearer work assignments
- Better production tracking later
