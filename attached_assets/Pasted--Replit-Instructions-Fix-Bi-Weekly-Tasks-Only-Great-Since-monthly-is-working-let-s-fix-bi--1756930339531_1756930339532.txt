# Replit Instructions: Fix Bi-Weekly Tasks Only

## Great! Since monthly is working, let's fix bi-weekly tasks specifically.

## How Bi-Weekly Should Work

Each month has TWO bi-weekly task instances:

### First Half of Month
- **Generated**: On the 1st of the month
- **Visible**: From 1st through 14th (14 days total)
- **Due**: On the 14th
- **Example**: Task created Sept 1, visible Sept 1-14, due Sept 14

### Second Half of Month  
- **Generated**: On the 15th of the month
- **Visible**: From 15th through last day of month (14-16 days total)
- **Due**: On the last day of month
- **Example**: Task created Sept 15, visible Sept 15-30, due Sept 30

## Step 1: Check Bi-Weekly Task Generation

Find where bi-weekly tasks are generated. It should create TWO separate tasks per month:

```javascript
// For bi-weekly tasks, you need:
// 1. One task for days 1-14
// 2. Another task for days 15-end
```

## Step 2: Verify Task IDs Are Unique

Each bi-weekly task instance needs a unique ID:
- First half: `{recurringId}-{year}-{month}-01`
- Second half: `{recurringId}-{year}-{month}-15`

## Step 3: Check the Frequency Field

Make sure bi-weekly tasks have the correct frequency value:
- Check if it's `'biweekly'` or `'bi-weekly'` (no space vs hyphen)
- Be consistent throughout the system

## Step 4: Fix Bi-Weekly Date Logic

For the first half (generated on 1st):
- visibleFromDate: 1st of current month
- dueDate: 14th of current month

For the second half (generated on 15th):
- visibleFromDate: 15th of current month  
- dueDate: Last day of current month (28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st)

## Step 5: Add Period Labels

Each bi-weekly task should indicate which half of the month:
- First half: Add label "1st-14th"
- Second half: Add label "15th-31st" (or 28th/29th/30th)

## Common Issues with Bi-Weekly

1. **Only creating one task per month** - Should be TWO
2. **Wrong date ranges** - Each should cover ~14 days
3. **Not generating on the 15th** - Need generation on both 1st AND 15th
4. **Frequency mismatch** - 'biweekly' vs 'bi-weekly' inconsistency
5. **ID conflicts** - Both halves having same ID prevents second from being created

## Expected Behavior

On September 3rd, you should see:
- First bi-weekly task (visible since Sept 1, due Sept 14)
- NOT the second bi-weekly task yet (that appears Sept 15)

On September 20th, you should see:
- Second bi-weekly task (visible since Sept 15, due Sept 30)
- NOT the first bi-weekly task (that was due Sept 14)

## The Key Difference from Monthly

Monthly = ONE task visible all month
Bi-Weekly = TWO tasks, each visible for half the month
