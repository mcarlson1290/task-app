# Replit Instructions: Add Assign Feature to Education Page

## Task Overview
Modify the education page to add an "Assigned" tab that shows by default, displaying only courses assigned to the current user. Managers and Corporate managers should be able to assign courses to any user.

## Step 1: Update Tab Navigation
In the education page component, modify the tab buttons to:
1. Add "Assigned" as the first tab
2. Set "Assigned" as the default active tab instead of "All Courses"
3. Update the tab order to: Assigned | All Courses | In Progress | Completed | Not Started

## Step 2: Create Database Table for Assignments
Create a new table called `course_assignments` with these columns:
- id (primary key)
- course_id (foreign key to courses table)
- assigned_to_user_id (foreign key to users table)
- assigned_by_user_id (foreign key to users table)
- assigned_date (timestamp)
- due_date (date, nullable)
- priority (varchar, default 'normal')
- notes (text, nullable)
- completed (boolean, default false)

## Step 3: Add Assignment UI for Managers
For users with role "Manager" or "Corporate":
1. Add an "Assign" button on each course card
2. When clicked, show a modal/dropdown with:
   - Searchable list of all users
   - Checkbox next to each user name
   - "Select All" option at the top
   - "Assign" and "Cancel" buttons

## Step 4: Filter Logic for Assigned Tab
When "Assigned" tab is active:
1. Query the course_assignments table for records where assigned_to_user_id = current user
2. Join with courses table to get course details
3. Display only these assigned courses
4. Show "No assigned courses" message if empty

## Step 5: Visual Indicators
On course cards in the Assigned tab, add:
1. "Assigned by: [Name]" text below the course title
2. "Due: [Date]" if a due date exists
3. A small badge icon (like a target 🎯) to indicate it's assigned

## Step 6: Permissions Check
Ensure only users with role "Manager" or "Corporate" see the Assign button:
```javascript
if (currentUser.role === 'Manager' || currentUser.role === 'Corporate') {
  // Show assign button
}
```

## Step 7: Assignment Action
When a manager assigns a course:
1. Insert records into course_assignments table
2. Show success message: "Course assigned to X users"
3. Refresh the view if on the Assigned tab

## Step 8: Update Progress Tracking
In the "Your Learning Progress" section at the top:
1. Change "1 Courses Completed" to show assigned courses: "3 Courses Assigned • 1 Completed"
2. Update progress bar to reflect assigned vs completed ratio
