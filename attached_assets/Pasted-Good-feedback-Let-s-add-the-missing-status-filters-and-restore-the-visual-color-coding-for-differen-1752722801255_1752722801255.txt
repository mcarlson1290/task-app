Good feedback! Let's add the missing status filters and restore the visual color coding for different task statuses:

1. ADD STATUS FILTERS:
   After the "All Tasks" and "Category" buttons, add these filter buttons:
   - Status (dropdown with options):
     * All Statuses
     * Assigned
     * In Progress 
     * Completed
     * Overdue
     * Skipped
     * Paused
   
   - Priority (dropdown with options):
     * All Priorities
     * High
     * Medium
     * Low
   
   - Date Picker:
     * Default to "Today"
     * Allow selecting past and future dates
     * Optional: Add visual indicator (like a dot) on dates with incomplete tasks

2. RESTORE STATUS COLOR CODING:
   The status badges should have different colors for quick visual scanning:
   
   ```css
   /* In Progress - Yellow/Orange */
   .status-in-progress {
     background-color: #f59e0b;
     color: white;
   }
   
   /* Pending/Assigned - Blue */
   .status-pending {
     background-color: #3b82f6;
     color: white;
   }
   
   /* Completed - Green */
   .status-completed {
     background-color: #10b981;
     color: white;
   }
   
   /* Overdue - Red */
   .status-overdue {
     background-color: #ef4444;
     color: white;
   }
   
   /* Skipped - Gray */
   .status-skipped {
     background-color: #6b7280;
     color: white;
   }
   
   /* Paused - Purple */
   .status-paused {
     background-color: #8b5cf6;
     color: white;
   }

FILTER BAR LAYOUT:
Desktop view:
[All Tasks (4)] [Category ▼] [Status ▼] [Priority ▼] [📅 Today ▼] [Search bar...]
Mobile view (stack vertically or use a filter icon that opens a modal)
KEEP THE EXISTING IMPROVEMENTS:

Priority text below the colored status badge (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
The category dropdown you just added
Clean task card layout



This gives users multiple ways to filter their tasks while maintaining the at-a-glance color system!

This will make the task list much more powerful for filtering while keeping the visual status indicators that help with quick scanning!
