# Replit Instructions: Re-Enable Task Data and Production Data Tabs

**IMPORTANT:** Do not delete any existing tasks, recurring tasks, or user data. This is a UI-only change to re-enable navigation items.

---

## Context

During soft launch, the **Task Data** and **Production Data** tabs were disabled with "Soon" badges to prevent users from accessing incomplete features. The features are now ready for production launch, so we need to:

1. Remove the "Soon" badges from both menu items
2. Make the links clickable/functional again
3. Ensure proper routing to the existing pages

## Step 1: Find the Sidebar Navigation Component

The sidebar navigation component is likely in one of these locations:
- `client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `client/src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- `client/src/components/Layout.tsx`
- `client/src/components/AppSidebar.tsx`

Look for the menu items array that contains objects with:
- `path` or `to` property
- `label` or `name` property
- `disabled` or `comingSoon` property
- The "Soon" badge text

---

## Step 2: Update Task Data Menu Item

**Find code that looks like this:**
```tsx
{
  path: '/task-data',
  label: 'Task Data',
  icon: BarChart3,
  disabled: true,        // REMOVE or set to false
  comingSoon: true,      // REMOVE or set to false
  managerOnly: true
}
```

**Change to:**
```tsx
{
  path: '/task-data',
  label: 'Task Data',
  icon: BarChart3,
  disabled: false,       // Now enabled
  // Remove comingSoon property entirely
  managerOnly: true
}
```

---

## Step 3: Update Production Data Menu Item

**Find code that looks like this:**
```tsx
{
  path: '/production-data',
  label: 'Production Data',
  icon: Leaf,
  disabled: true,        // REMOVE or set to false
  comingSoon: true,      // REMOVE or set to false
  managerOnly: true
}
```

**Change to:**
```tsx
{
  path: '/production-data',
  label: 'Production Data',
  icon: Leaf,
  disabled: false,       // Now enabled
  // Remove comingSoon property entirely
  managerOnly: true
}
```

---

## Step 4: Remove the "Soon" Badge Rendering

Look for the JSX that renders the "Soon" badge. It might look like:

**Current code:**
```tsx
<NavLink to={item.path} className={item.disabled ? 'nav-disabled' : ''}>
  <item.icon className="nav-icon" />
  <span>{item.label}</span>
  {item.comingSoon && <span className="soon-badge">Soon</span>}
</NavLink>
```

**Or with conditional disabled styling:**
```tsx
{item.disabled ? (
  <div className="nav-item nav-disabled" title="Coming Soon">
    <item.icon className="nav-icon" />
    <span>{item.label}</span>
    <span className="soon-badge">Soon</span>
  </div>
) : (
  <NavLink to={item.path} className="nav-item">
    <item.icon className="nav-icon" />
    <span>{item.label}</span>
  </NavLink>
)}
```

**Update to always render as clickable NavLink** (the condition will handle it automatically once `disabled` is false).

---

## Step 5: Verify Routing Exists

Confirm these routes exist in your router configuration (likely `client/src/App.tsx` or `client/src/routes.tsx`):

```tsx
<Route path="/task-data" element={<TaskData />} />
<Route path="/production-data" element={<ProductionData />} />
```

The pages should already exist at:
- `client/src/pages/TaskData.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/ProductionData.tsx`

---

## Step 6: Clean Up CSS (Optional)

If there's specific disabled styling, you can leave it in place (it won't apply once items aren't disabled). But you may want to verify the `.soon-badge` class isn't being applied anymore.

---

## Expected Result

After these changes:
- ✅ Task Data appears in sidebar without "Soon" badge
- ✅ Task Data link is clickable and navigates to `/task-data`
- ✅ Production Data appears in sidebar without "Soon" badge
- ✅ Production Data link is clickable and navigates to `/production-data`
- ✅ Both items remain visible only to Manager and Corporate roles (managerOnly: true)
- ✅ All existing pages and data remain untouched

## Testing Checklist

1. [ ] Log in as a Manager or Corporate user
2. [ ] Verify Task Data appears in sidebar without "Soon" badge
3. [ ] Click Task Data - confirm it navigates correctly
4. [ ] Verify Production Data appears in sidebar without "Soon" badge
5. [ ] Click Production Data - confirm it navigates correctly
6. [ ] Log in as Staff user - confirm both items are still hidden (role-based visibility)
7. [ ] Check mobile view - tabs should work on mobile as well

## Quick Reference: File Locations

| What | Likely Location |
|------|-----------------|
| Sidebar/Navigation | `client/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` or `Navigation.tsx` |
| Routes | `client/src/App.tsx` |
| Task Data Page | `client/src/pages/TaskData.tsx` |
| Production Data Page | `client/src/pages/ProductionData.tsx` |
| Styles | `client/src/index.css` or component-level CSS |

## Notes

- These pages already have sub-tabs (Task Data has Analytics, Production Data has Live Dashboard, Tray Tracking, Equipment, Crop Config)
- The data and functionality on these pages is already built
- We're just re-enabling the navigation links
