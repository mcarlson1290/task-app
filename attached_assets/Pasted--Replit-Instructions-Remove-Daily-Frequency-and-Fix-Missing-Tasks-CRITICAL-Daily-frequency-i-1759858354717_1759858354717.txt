# Replit Instructions: Remove Daily Frequency and Fix Missing Tasks

**CRITICAL: Daily frequency is being ELIMINATED. Convert all daily tasks to weekly. Also find the missing monthly/bi-weekly/quarterly tasks.**

## Part 1: Remove Daily Frequency Completely

### Remove from UI
1. **In the frequency dropdown**, remove "Daily" as an option
2. **Frequency options should only be:**
   - Weekly
   - Bi-Weekly  
   - Monthly
   - Quarterly

### Remove from Code
1. **Find all references to 'daily' frequency and remove them**
2. **Update any switch/case statements** that handle frequency
3. **Update validation** to reject 'daily' as a valid frequency

## Part 2: Convert ALL Daily Tasks to Weekly

### Migration Logic
```
For each recurring task where frequency = 'daily':
1. Change frequency to 'weekly'
2. Keep the existing day selections (they already work for weekly)
3. Update any generated task instances to reflect weekly frequency
4. Log the conversion for audit
```

### Important
- If a daily task had Mon-Fri selected, it becomes a weekly task with Mon-Fri selected
- If a daily task had all 7 days selected, it becomes a weekly task with all 7 days
- The functionality remains EXACTLY the same, just cleaner labeling

## Part 3: Find Missing Monthly/Bi-Weekly/Quarterly Tasks

### Investigate Why They Disappeared
1. **Check if they exist in database but aren't displaying**
2. **Check if they were accidentally deleted during duplicate cleanup**
3. **Check if the filter is hiding non-weekly tasks**
4. **Check if the generation system is only creating weekly tasks**

### Recovery Steps
1. **Query database for ALL recurring tasks**
   - Log how many of each frequency type exist
   - If monthly/bi-weekly/quarterly exist in DB, it's a display issue
   - If they don't exist, they need to be restored or recreated

2. **Check the recurring tasks page filter**
   - Ensure "All Frequencies" actually shows all frequencies
   - Remove any hardcoded filters that only show daily/weekly

3. **Verify generation logic handles all frequencies**
   - Monthly: Generate on 1st
   - Bi-Weekly: Generate on 1st and 15th
   - Quarterly: Generate on quarter starts

## Part 4: Ensure All Frequencies Work

### Test Each Frequency Type
After removing daily and fixing the display:

1. **Weekly**: Should generate on selected days of week
2. **Bi-Weekly**: Should generate two tasks per month (1st-14th, 15th-end)
3. **Monthly**: Should generate one task visible entire month
4. **Quarterly**: Should generate one task per quarter

### Fix Frequency Display/Generation
Ensure the system:
- Saves the correct frequency to database
- Generates tasks according to frequency rules
- Displays frequency badges correctly
- Filters properly by frequency

## Part 5: Permanent Solution

### Database Constraints
- Add CHECK constraint: frequency IN ('weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly')
- This prevents 'daily' from ever being saved again

### Clear Documentation
Make it obvious that:
- **Weekly** = Runs on specific days each week (replaces old daily)
- **Bi-Weekly** = Twice per month (1st-14th, 15th-end)
- **Monthly** = Once per month (visible all month)
- **Quarterly** = Once per quarter

## What NOT to Do

❌ Do NOT just hide daily tasks - convert them to weekly
❌ Do NOT delete any tasks - convert or fix them
❌ Do NOT hardcode solutions - fix the root cause
❌ Do NOT ignore the missing monthly/bi-weekly/quarterly tasks

## Immediate Actions

1. **First**: Log all existing recurring tasks and their frequencies
2. **Second**: Convert all daily → weekly
3. **Third**: Find why monthly/bi-weekly/quarterly aren't showing
4. **Fourth**: Remove daily from UI and validation
5. **Fifth**: Test all frequency types work correctly

## Success Criteria

- Daily frequency no longer exists anywhere in the system
- All former daily tasks now work as weekly tasks
- Monthly, Bi-Weekly, and Quarterly tasks are visible and working
- Each frequency generates tasks correctly
- No data loss during conversion
